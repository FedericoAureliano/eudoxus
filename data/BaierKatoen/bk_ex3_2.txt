Build a model for the classic dining philosophers problem:

Five philosophers are sitting at a round table with a bowl of rice in the middle. For the philosophers (being a little unworldly) life consists of thinking and eating (and waiting, as we will see). To take some rice out of the bowl, a philosopher needs two chopsticks. In between two neighboring philosophers, however, there is only a single chopstick. Thus, at any time only one of two neighboring philosophers can eat. Of course, the use of the chopsticks is exclusive and eating with hands is forbidden.


Write a property that checks whether deadlock is possible.

Use the variable names phil1, phil2, phil3, phil4, phil5, chopstick1, chopstick2, chopstick3, chopstick4, and chopstick5
