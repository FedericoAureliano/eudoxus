We are given three (primitive) processes P1,P2, and P3 with shared integer variable x. The program of each process is as follows:

for ki = 1,...,10 do
 LOAD(x); 
 INC(x); 
 STORE(x);
od

That is, each process executes ten times the assignment x:=x+1.

The assignment x := x+1 is realized using the three actions LOAD(x), INC(x) and STORE(x). Consider now the parallel program:

x := 0;
P1 || P2 || P3

Build a model of the parallel program. Write a property that checkes if P has an execution that halts with the terinal value x=2.
