The following program is a mutual exclusion protocol for two processes due to Pnueli. There is a single shared variable s which is either 0 or 1, and initially 1. Besides, each process has a local Boolean variable y that initially equals 0. The program text for each process Pi (i=0,1) is as follows:


l0: loop forever do begin
l1: Noncritical section
l2: (yi, s) := (1, i);
l3: wait until ((y1−i = 0) ∨ (s ̸= i)); l4: Critical section
l5: yi := 0
end.


Here, the statement (yi, s) := (1, i); is a multiple assignment in which variable yi := 1 and s := i is a single, atomic step.

Model a parallel composition of P0 and P1.

Write a property that checks whether the algorithm ensures mutual exclusion and a property that checks whether the algorithm ensures starvation freedom.
