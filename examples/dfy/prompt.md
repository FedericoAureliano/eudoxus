I want to write code to reason about whether a function is correct.  You have access to a dafny python library that you import with
import dafnypy

You can use the following key functions in the package:
- `dafnypy.requires(expr)` guarantees the inputs to a function are well formed. Note this assertion can only use program arguments.
- `dafnypy.ensures(expr)` guarantees the inputs to a function are well formed. Note this assertion can only use program arguments and the `result` reserved keyword .
- `dafnypy.invariant(expr)` guarantees the loop maintains this invariant to be always true.
- `dafny.decreases(expr)` specifies that the value of the expression will always decrease each time this function is called.

----------------------------------
Consider an example function

```python
from typing import List
import dafnypy

@dafnypy.verify
def KthElement(arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    # Precondition: requires statements for precondition
    dafnypy.requires(1 <=k)
    dafnypy.requires(k <= len(arr))

    # Main function body
    result = arr[k - 1]

    # Post-condition: ensures statements for post-condition
    dafnypy.ensures(result == arr[k-1])
    return result
```
This produces the following dafny:

```dafny
//Write a method in Dafny to find the kth element in the given array using 1-based indexing.
method KthElement(arr: array<int>, k: int) returns (result: int)
  requires 1 <= k <= arr.Length
  ensures result == arr[k - 1]
{
  result := arr[k - 1];
}
```

--------------------------------------------

Here's another example using a loop:

```python
import dafnypy

@dafnypy.verify
def increment(m: int, n: int) -> int:
    # Precondition: requires statements for precondition
    dafnypy.requires(m<=n)

    i = m
    # Main function body
    while i < n:
        # Invariant: ensures that i is bounded
        dafnypy.invariant(0<=i)
        dafnypy.invariant(i<=n)
        dafnypy.decreases(n-i)
        i += 1
    result = i

    # Post-condition: ensures statements for post-condition
    dafnypy.ensures(result == n)
    return result
```

```dafny
method increment(m: nat, n: int) returns (result: int)
  requires m <= n
  ensures result == n
{
  var i := m;
  while i < n
    invariant 0 <= i <= n
    decreases n - i
  {
    i := i + 1;
  }
  result := i;
}
```

Use dafnypy to verify that the following implementation is correct:

<PY_IMP>

Be sure to have loop invariants that imply the post condition.
Remember to annotate with the types using python typing.

Provide a python implementation using functions from dafnypy to verify.
