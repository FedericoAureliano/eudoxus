           │ > Model a program that has two variables: request of type boolean and status of enumeration type {ready, busy}: 0 denotes 'false' and 1 represents 'true.' The initial and subsequent values of    │
           │ variable request are not determined within this program; this conservatively models that these values are determined by an external environment. This under-specification of request implies that  │
           │ the value of variable status is partially determined: initially, it is ready; and it becomes busy whenever request is true. If request is false, the next value of status is not determined. Write │
           │ a property that checks that, if request is true, eventually status becomes busy. You can introduce auxiliary variables to do this. Use the variable names request and status.                      │

           │ This pseudo-python code assumes formal methods tools that can handle logical constructs like liveness properties (`eventually`). It sketches out how you might set up a model to simulate and      │
           │ verify properties of an asynchronous system using a class that inherits from `Module`. Each method is designed to fit into the framework with specific tasks, such as defining types, handling     │
           │ input variables, setting initial conditions, defining state transitions, and specifying properties to check system correctness. The specific method and attribute names (`Enum`, `Boolean`,        │
           │ `Eventually`) are placeholders and would have to align with the actual methods in the formal method tool or simulation environment being used.                                                     │
