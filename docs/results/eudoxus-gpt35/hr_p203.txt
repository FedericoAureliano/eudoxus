           │ > The alternating bit protocol (ABP) is a protocol for transmitting messages along a 'lossy line,' i.e., a line which may lose or duplicate messages. The protocol guarantees that, providing the  │
           │ line doesn't lose infinitely many messages, communication between the sender and the receiver will be successful. (We allow the line to lose or duplicate messages, but it may not corrupt         │
           │ messages; however, there is no way of guaranteeing successful transmission along a line which can corrupt.) The ABP works as follows. There are four entities, or agents: the sender, the          │
           │ receiver, the message channel and the acknowledgement channel. The sender transmits the first part of the message together with the 'control' bit 0. If, and when, the receiver receives a message │
           │ with the control bit 0, it sends 0 along the acknowledgement channel. When the sender receives this acknowledgement, it sends the next packet with the control bit 1. If and when the receiver     │
           │ receives this, it acknowledges by sending a 1 on the acknowledgement channel. By alternating the control bit, both receiver and sender can guard against duplicating messages and losing messages  │
           │ (i.e., they ignore messages that have the unexpected control bit). If the sender doesn't get the expected acknowledgement, it continually re-sends the message, until the acknowledgement arrives. │
           │ If the receiver doesn't get a message with the expected control bit, it continually resends the previous acknowledgement. Write a model for the alternating bit protocol. Write a set of           │
           │ properties that check that your model behaves as described above. Use the variable names st, message1, message2 and ack.                                                                           │

           │ > The alternating bit protocol (ABP) is a protocol for transmitting messages along a 'lossy line,' i.e., a line which may lose or duplicate messages. The protocol guarantees that, providing the  │
           │ line doesn't lose infinitely many messages, communication between the sender and the receiver will be successful. (We allow the line to lose or duplicate messages, but it may not corrupt         │
           │ messages; however, there is no way of guaranteeing successful transmission along a line which can corrupt.) The ABP works as follows. There are four entities, or agents: the sender, the          │
           │ receiver, the message channel and the acknowledgement channel. The sender transmits the first part of the message together with the 'control' bit 0. If, and when, the receiver receives a message │
           │ with the control bit 0, it sends 0 along the acknowledgement channel. When the sender receives this acknowledgement, it sends the next packet with the control bit 1. If and when the receiver     │
           │ receives this, it acknowledges by sending a 1 on the acknowledgement channel. By alternating the control bit, both receiver and sender can guard against duplicating messages and losing messages  │
           │ (i.e., they ignore messages that have the unexpected control bit). If the sender doesn't get the expected acknowledgement, it continually re-sends the message, until the acknowledgement arrives. │
           │ If the receiver doesn't get a message with the expected control bit, it continually resends the previous acknowledgement. Write a model for the alternating bit protocol. Write a set of           │
           │ properties that check that your model behaves as described above. Use the variable names st, message1, message2 and ack.                                                                           │
